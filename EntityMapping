Add new Entity Model --> Producer, ProducerWebsite

Objective: Combine Entities

Add new Scalar Property in Producer Entity --> Define it as Website

See Mapping Details - Producer mapped to Producer, ProducerWebsite mapped to ProducerWebsite
Under Producer--> Add Maps to ProducerWebSite

ERROR: WEBSITE IS ALSO MAPPED TO THE SAME THING
Delete Key:

Now we only have one class called Producer, but we have 2 tables (One Entity, Two Tables)
Hence working with one entity, but update both tables.
